# Repository Guidelines

- This repository hosts a PaperMC plugin project built with Maven.
- Keep Java source under `src/main/java`, organized by package (`com.example.tinyhunt` unless the scope requires otherwise).
- Resource files (e.g., `plugin.yml`) belong in `src/main/resources`.
- Prefer descriptive class names and JavaDoc for new public APIs.
- Avoid embedding CSS or JavaScript directly in HTML templates within this repository.
- Update this file with any additional conventions as the project evolves.
